CROWDFUNDING ANALYSIS

Crowdfunding is a popular and effective way that centers around raising money. It aims to achieve a funding goal, meant to finance a business or project, or create a buzz.

CONCLUSION FROM THE ANALYSIS:

•	Based on the crowdfunding data provided, it is evident that more than half of the instances, had a successful crowdfunding. Most of the successful projects in the sample, exceeded their funding goal. The success rate of the crowdfunding has increased gradually from 2010.

•	From the analysis it is observed that a greater number of campaigns ran for the category-theatre/plays. Country-wise it’s clear that the United States had a greater number of crowdfunding campaigns. The data collected from the countries shows the theatre/plays is the most popular category. A greater number of campaigns ran for the “plays” sub-category and overall had collected a good amount of funding.

•	From the Goal analysis it is seen that the chances of being unsuccessful increases significantly for the projects which had a goal of 50,000 and above.

LIMITATIONS:

Data provided could have listed the crowdfunding platform or medium used by the company. The data did not provide any attribute to infer, the rationale that attracted the investors to finance the project. Provisioning of details about the promotional tools utilized by the company to advertise their project, would have helped to understand the factors associated with success or failure of projects. For instance, Did the company create any video that attracted the backers? Or was there any connecting social appeal that helped.

Demographic details of the company organizer and the individual who pledged for the project could have helped to understand the success rate in a different perspective. Details such as eventual success of a business or impact created by a business which was funded by the crowdfunding, could help in establishing the mindset of the successful investors to support one crowdfunding project, but not the other.

OTHER POSSIBLE TABLE/GRAPHS AND VALUES TO INFER:

•	A separate table and a graph categorizing the amount pledged for each country and corresponding success percentage could help to determine the relationship between a progressive economy and project success.

•	Analysis based on the duration and goal pledged with a chart representation would help to find if there is any direct relationship between the time frame and the success or failure rate of the crowdfunding.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

•	Since the crowdfunding data provided has outliers, Median would best summarize the data.

•	Variance describes the degree of spread in the data. The data provided has outliers that significantly increases the variability. Both successful and unsuccessful campaign has high variance. Successful campaign has high variability in comparison to unsuccessful campaign. The graph plotted for successful and unsuccessful campaign would be asymmetrical due to the skewed data.
